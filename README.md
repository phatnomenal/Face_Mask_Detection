# Image Processing Project using Google Colab

## Overview
This project implements an image processing and deep learning pipeline using **Python** on **Google Colab**.  
The main objective is to train and evaluate a model for image-based detection tasks using GPU acceleration provided by Colab.

## Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Deep Learning (YOLO / CNN)

## Project Files
- `FaceMask_Detection_Colab.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook containing all code
- `data/`: Dataset for training and testing
- `results/`: Output images and evaluation results

## Workflow
1. Install required libraries  
2. Load and preprocess image data  
3. Train the deep learning model  
4. Evaluate model performance  
5. Test the model on new images or videos  

## How to Run
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab  
2. Set runtime to **GPU**  
3. Run all cells sequentially  

## Results
The trained model can detect objects in images with good accuracy and visualize predictions directly in Colab.
